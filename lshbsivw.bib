abstract = {The payment of life insurance policy benefits to the insured's suriving spouse or child is something with which most people are both familiar and comfortable. However, when those benefits are instead paid to a third party investor who has no interest in the insured's life, some people cry foul. Yet this is the basic premise of the secondary market for life insurance. In this market, insured individuals assign their policy benefits to an investor who agrees to pay the insured a lump sum of money in addition to assuming responsibility for the policy's premiums. While the underlying concepts that support the secondary market for life insurance policies are not new, the young and imperfectly regulated market has been strained by an increase in supply and demand for these products. Because of the limited guidance within the market, fraud and uncertainty have pervaded many transactions. As a result, many validly settled policies may face challenges in the courts. In an effort to help stabilize and legitimize the secondary market, this Comment recommends coupling a strict judicial interpretation of the incontestability periods contained in many life insurance policies with a five year holding period on newly issued life insurance policies. This framework will help deter fraudulent transactions while promoting certainty among investors.},

abstract = {Investors seeking new structures for acquiring policies in the life settlement market encounter several underlying risks unique to the asset class. Those risks, described in this article, include contestability risk, missing body risk, insurable interest risk, incorrect-purchase-price risk, life insurance company credit risk, cost-of-insurance risk, and longevity risk. Some risks can be easily mitigated, but others require more complicated risk transfer mechanisms that combine financial products with insurance products. These products range from contestability coverage to more sophisticated mortality risk transfer constructs that blend equity derivative products with property casualty insurance. As the life settlement market evolves, risk mitigation will play an increasing role in reducing volatility and enabling predictable returns to allow for more institutional capital participation. Knowledge about the risks and the available risk mitigation solutions becomes a must for prospective investors interested in entering into the life settlement market.},

abstract = {Acquirers of life settlements or investments linked to them rely on medical underwriters to help assess the mortality risk for each underwritten life. However, for the non-actuary investor, evaluating potential deviations in actual experience from the underwriters' assessment relative to the investors' risk tolerance is a critical challenge. This article provides a framework for the development of a methodology for the investment community to understand potential deviations from expected experience for a life settlement portfolio. When considering an investment in an asset in which cash flows are backed by the economics of life insurance policies, the investor should consider 1) eligibility guidelines for the pool of lives underlying the investment, and 2) expected return on the investment and related risks. Because mortality risk is the primary risk, an understanding of the underwriting process for each individual life insurance policy is a key to analyzing the investment.},

@article{Perera2007,
abstract = {Investors transacting in life settlement policies face many risks. But the most often raised concern from any life settlement investor surrounds extension risk, which is the probability that an insured individual lives well beyond his or her life expectancy. The risk presents two problems: 1) that the death benefit arrives later but does not grow with time and 2) that the ongoing premiums drain the investment returns. However, with the consumer market pressing to cash in their insurance policies, equity investors expanding the life settlement market may find emerging mortality solutions will bring bankers to the table. This article explores several solutions that mitigate the mortality uncertainty and enable the successful execution of financial transactions. A life-contingent, single-premium annuity structure combines a single-premium immediate annuity with a settled life insurance policy, incorporating debt-like characteristics of principal protection while providing the necessary mortality hedge. Residual value insurance has been developed to insure a policy's future value, making premium finance programs that use traditional lending more efficient. Mortality index swaps, which utilize recently developed mortality indices, allow life settlement providers and life insurance companies to indirectly hedge each others' risks. Principal protection insurance protects a life settlement portfolio manager from extended life expectancy over an entire portfolio. Now with the innovative risk mitigation solutions emerging, investors are able to combine traditional lending facilities with mortality risk transfer products and thus deploy capital more efficiently towards life settlements.},

First, we claim and then demonstrate that conventional longevity-linked securities do not perform as effectively in the secondary life market, that is, life settlement market, as in the annuity and pension markets due to the basis risk that exists between the general population and the life settlement subgroup.

abstract = {The life settlement business, which involves the sale of life insurance policies prior to maturity, is thriving. Unfortunately, the growth of the life settlement business has been fueled, at least in part, by stranger-originated life insurance (SOLI or STOLI or SPIN-LIFE) programs where brokers or speculators encourage individuals through economic incentives such as "free insurance," cruises, cash payments, and the like to acquire life insurance policies directly or indirectly on their lives, with the intent that the policies be sold over time to investors who have no insurable interest in their lives. The National Association of Life Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) model act moved to end STOLI and strengthen consumer protection in the life settlement area. The National Conference of Insurance Legislators (NCOIL) model act serves as an alternative to the NAIC model act. This article summarizes the NCOIL model act and provides a broad-brush comparison of the NAIC and NCOIL model acts.},

At first glance the financial crisis should actually spur the growth of the market in senior life settlements. This is because on the supply side of the market significant amounts of wealth of senior citizens have been lost in the stock, bond, and real estate markets. On the other hand, factors on the demand side of the market have reduced the offered prices for life insurance policies. Interestingly, the most dramatic event that impacted the life settlements market as the financial markets entered the crisis stage in the autumn of 2008, was the decision by the directors of 21st Services to revise their mortality tables. The author concludes that the element that creates a sustainable market in life settlements is the increased transparency of pricing on both sides of the market.},

This lack of standardization has been and still is the major roadblock against widespread use of life settlements as investment, diversication and portfolio risk management tools. However, the recent crisis of 2007 has revealed high levels of correlation among existing financial instruments that are in widespread use. This revelation raised an avid interest in new financial instruments that show low correlation to strong market swings. In this respect, life settlements and related products such as death bonds have gained popularity among practitioners and academics alike. This paper proposes a standard pricing framework for life settlements that is consistent with existing methods of risk management and sensitivity analysis widely used in fixed income products.},

With life settlements, investors make substantial payments to the insured individuals upon purchasing such policies, pay any remaining premiums, and collect the death benefits upon the demise of the insured individuals. Transactions involving life settlements seem poised to become a major source of profits for investment banks, comparable in dollar amount to subprime mortgages. With life settlements, the insured individuals suffer no immediate harm, and the sale of a policy an individual owns is permissible under current law. Nevertheless, moral questions can be posed about the social values expressed by these practices, the effect of these practices on the virtue of charity, and the overall loss of social utility that will result from life settlements. We consider life settlements from utilitarian and libertarian perspectives, and then consider the effects of life settlements on social values and on individual character. On balance, we favor legislative changes in insurance and tax laws to discourage life settlements, and argue that certain forms of life settlements should be banned outright.},

Since the funds contained in our data set cover a large fraction of this relatively young segment of the capital markets, representative conclusions can be derived. Even though the empirical results suggest that life settlement funds offer attractive returns paired with low volatility and are virtually uncorrelated with other asset classes, we find latent risk factors such as liquidity, longevity, and valuation risks. Since these risks did generally not materialize in the past and are hence largely not reflected by the historical data, they cannot be captured by classical performance measures. Thus, caution is advised in order not to overestimate the performance of this asset class.},

abstract = {In April 2006, the American Council of Life Insurers (ACLI) circulated a legislative proposal that would impose a 100 percent excise tax on the proceeds from the sale of a life insurance policy to a third-party within five years of the issuance of the policy. The practical effect of such a rule would be to increase the holding period for a life-insurance policy from two to five years. Although the proposal has not yet garnered sufficient support in Congress, as of April 2008, the five-year holding period was being considered as 'model legislation' by several U.S. states. To measure the costs of the ACLI proposal to policyowners, we introduce the real options framework of financial economics. The option to sell can be modeled using traditional Black-Scholes techniques as a European put option during the holding period and as an American put option after the holding period expires. We calculate that the senior candidates for a life settlement would instantaneously lose between U.S.$41 billion and U.S.$63 billion in option value if the ACLI's proposal were implemented. Against these costs, one must measure the likely benefits of extending the holding period. Until such a cost-benefit analysis is performed, it would be imprudent to constrain policyholders in such a severe way.},

abstract = {Given the extraordinary growth of the U.S. life settlement industry over the last decade, it is not surprising to find increased attention and scrutiny by academicians, the media and legal enforcement authorities–including, among others, state and federal securities regulatory and self-regulatory organizations. The securities laws regulators argue that investments in all forms of life settlement transactions involve the sale of securities, and that the full spectrum of securities laws applies. For the most part, they may be right. In discussing the pertinent securities-related issues surrounding life settlements, there are three fundamental questions to be addressed: 1) Does the sale of the life insurance policy to a passive investor that relies on others to conduct due diligence, price the policy, carry out the transaction, and perform follow-up services involve the sale of a "security" under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act")? 2) Do the "registration" requirements under the 1933 Act apply? 3) Do sales activities in connection with the sale of the life insurance policy trigger any broker-dealer registration requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act")? This article concludes that the sale of the entire interest in an in-force life insurance policy to a passive investor may very well involve the sale of a security. The sale can be structured so that it is exempt from the registration requirements of state and federal laws. However, the state and federal anti-fraud provisions will apply to the transaction; and any person effecting the sale, particularly if compensated on the basis of the size of a successful sale, might be required to register with the SEC (and the applicable state) as a broker-dealer and be licensed as a security salesperson by the NASD.},

abstract = {Fair value accounting aims to establish a three-level hierarchy that distinguishes (1) readily observable measurement inputs from (2) less readily observable measurement inputs and (3) unobservable measurement inputs. Level 3 longevity valued assets will pose unique valuation risks once securitised pools of these alternative asset classes come to market as investment vehicles for pension plans and individual retirement accounts. No uniform framework is available to assure consistent fair market valuation and transparency for investor decision-making. Applying existing international auditing standards and analytical procedures (IFRS 13) will offer a platform upon which fund managers, their auditors and actuaries can agree upon uniform valuation and presentation guidelines. Application of these quasi-governmental standards will bring future liquidity to otherwise illiquid capital market instruments. This paper presents a valuation methodology consistent with fair value accounting and auditing standards. The methodology incorporates the longevity predictive modelling of Stallard in a form that is compatible with Bayes Factor weighted average valuation techniques based on the study by Kass and Raftery. The methodology is applicable to fair valuation of life settlement portfolios where the combination of too few large death benefit policies and large variances in individual life expectancy estimates currently challenge accurate valuation and periodic re-valuation.},

abstract = {In this article the authors define a reference time called t0, in longevity/value space, as the longevity that drives a life settlement contract to a zero value. They develop the t0 metric to show how the "longevity gap" collapses and expands as actual longevity of the pool of insured deviates from the forecasted longevity upon which the pricing of the life settlement contracts is based. The "longevity gap" or "gap" measures the value of the asset component of a life settlement contract (the death benefits), relative to the value of the liability component (the required premium payments). The longevity gap metric can be used by investors and creditors to measure the solvency of individual life settlement contracts or portfolios of life settlement contracts. Because the value of the asset side of a life settlement contract expands and declines at a different rate than the liability side when longevity changes, t0 becomes a threshold that investors can use to gauge and compare the longevity risk embedded in life settlement contracts that are being offered. The authors show that policies valued by simply discounting the stream of cash flows of life settlement contracts based on an expected longevity of the underlying population of insured can be misleading. Knowing at what longevity of the insured the policy will hit t0 offers valuable information.},

Life settlements are becoming recognized by planning professionals as a viable financial planning tool. Reasons why a client may want to consider selling an insurance policy include: 1. insurance needs have changed, 2. premiums have become unaffordable or inconsistent with current needs, 3. estate planning goals have changed, 4. cash is needed to fund a different life insurance policy, annuity, or investment, 5. funds are needed for long-term health care, and 6. funds are needed as a source of cash for charitable giving. Values-based case studies are presented. Total premiums paid by the policy owner are nontaxable and are the owner's cost basis. If the cash surrender value is greater than the total premium paid, the difference would be treated as ordinary income.

abstract = {The last 12 months have been very active in the life settlement industry. The life settlement market continued to expand in 2006 and, by some estimates, approximately $15 billion in face amount of policies were sold. Synthetic structures have also become available as a means to invest in life settlements without actually purchasing the physical life insurance policies. In addition to purchasing life settlements, lending into the life settlement market, and providing synthetic investment opportunities, in the past year a number of financial institutions have become part owners of life settlement providers. As further evidence of a maturing market, a number of exchanges, similar to commodities exchanges, are currently in operation, and more may be on the way. Life settlements are governed on a state-by-state basis, with 28 states having enacted laws to govern life settlements and several states having proposed legislation. The primary legislative guide for life settlement regulation has been the Viatical Settlement Model Act, promulgated by the National Asssociation of Insurance Commisioners in 2001. In May 2006, a movement to amend the Model Act began to gather momentum. In an effort to end the so-called stranger-originated life insurance (STOLI) or investor-originated life insurance business segment, the Life Insurance and Annuities (A) Committee proposed a prohibition on the sale of a life insurance policy during the first five years after the policy is issued. While the inexact nature of life expectancy determinations has been one factor that has delayed the arrival of securitization to this sector due to the difficulties encountered by the rating agencies in achieving a sufficient comfort level with life expectancy predictions, many believe that securitization presents the logical progression of the life settlement market.},

The proceeds of an insurance policy held by the insured on his or her life are included in the gross estate of the policyowner if he or she dies owning the policy. To avoid estate tax on these insurance proceeds, the owner may want to give the policy to an irrevocable trust or outright to the intended beneficiary(ies). But, under Section 2035, if the owner dies within three years of such a transfer, the death proceeds will be included in his or her taxable estate. To avoid this problem, the policyowner could sell the policy and at some later date, gift the proceeds of the sale.},

abstract = {In this article, we examine the benefits that an active secondary market for life insurance policies provides to the policyholder. We begin by briefly explaining the development of the secondary market for life insurance and the economic consequences of that development. Most notably, although insurance carriers typically offer reasonably competitive surrender values for policies, those carriers were monopsony repurchasers of life insurance policies before the advent of the secondary market. As a result, individuals with impaired health were unable to receive appropriate compensation before the development of viatical and life settlement firms. Viatical and life settlement firms erode this monopsony power and generate positive consumer welfare gains. Next, we evaluate the benefits and risks to individual policyholders associated with secondary market transactions and estimate the aggregate benefit of the secondary market to policyholders. The current consumer benefit from the secondary market is less than it could be because policyholders in many cases are not aware the market even exists. Indeed, the magnitude of the benefits is positively correlated to the quantity of coverage sold to life settlement firms and to the improvement in the terms of accelerated death benefits offered by incumbent carriers. Finally, we describe the evolving regulatory environment in which the secondary market functions.},

In most situations, the viatical settlement provider, now the owner of the insurance policy, assumes the costs and benefits of maintaining the policy: paying premiums to prevent the policy from lapsing, collecting dividends, and receiving the insured's death benefit when death occurs. A viator's sale or assignment of an insurance policy to a qualified viatical settlement provider must be of a life insurance contract. E. Failure to tender the viatical settlement by the date disclosed to the viator renders the contract null and void.

abstract = {Using duration to measure interest rate risk for securities such as MBS, callable bonds, and securities backed by life insurance policies is problematic because for these securities the timing of cash flows is uncertain. In order to measure duration for securities with embedded options like callable bonds and MBS, cash flow timing must be assumed or modeled. In the case of senior life settlements, duration is only a useful summary of interest rate risk if the estimated life of the insured is accurate. It is precisely because the life of the insured is uncertain that the duration of a pool of senior life settlement contracts will not offer a meaningful summary of interest rate risk. In this paper we illustrate how a pool of senior life settlement contracts can be funded with a capital structure that is composed of two classes of securities: one which has a duration that is insulated from variations in the life of the insured around the estimated life expectancy and the other with a duration which is highly sensitive to variations in the life of the insured around the estimated life expectancy. We name the security class with a stable duration the planned duration class (PDC) while the class with the unstable duration is called the support duration class (SDC)},

The most striking result is that a majority of asset managers seem to substantially overvalue their portfolios relative to the prices of comparable transactions that have recently been closed. Drawing on market-consistent estimates with regard to medical underwriting, it is possible to trace back the observed discrepancies to inadequately low model inputs for life expectancies and discount rates. The main consequences are a dissimilar treatment of investor groups in open-end funds structures as well as an unduly high compensation for managers and third parties.

Among the more significant drivers of this variation in structuring is a given investor's identification and understanding of the numerous tax issues that are potentially involved. The problem, however, has been the apparent lack of guidance as to how to apply potentially applicable tax rules that were not drafted with this evolving industry in mind.

We show how to incorporate this information into the investor's valuation in a rigorous and statistically justified manner. To incorporate medical information, we apply statistical information theory to adjust an appropriate prespecified standard mortality table so as to obtain a new mortality table that exactly reflects the known medical information.Weillustrate using several mortality tables including a new extension of the Lee-Carter model that allows for jumps in mortality and longevity over time. The information theoretically adjusted mortality table has a distribution consistent with the underwriter's projected life expectancy or other medical underwriter information and is as indistinguishable as possible from the prespecified mortality model.

By providing the industry with secure, business-to-business trading platforms specifically designed for life settlement transactions, online platforms address many of the inefficiencies and shortcomings currently facing this industry. Online exchanges lower the fixed costs associated with brokering, underwriting, and purchasing a life insurance policy and consequently provide the opportunity for smaller policies to be brokered in the secondary market. Electronic trading platforms provide the ideal solution to monitor, update, and report upon the requlatory requirements of both buyers and sellers. Transparency and disclosure is probably the most compelling justification for the use of electronic platforms. For securitization to develop and flourish, an electronic exchange will need to be in place to facilitate trades and transactions.},

abstract = {This first part of a two-part series article explores the elements of life settlements, the operation of the secondary life insurance market, and the duty of estate planning advisors to consider life settlements for their clients. In this article, the authors will explain why professional advisors and fiduciaries must understand the pros and cons of life settlements, how professionals can determine the economic value of life settlements on behalf of their clients, and how advisors can ensure a life settlement transaction is conducted in an ethical, legal, and economically responsible manner. A life settlement is the sale to a third-party purchaser of an in-force life insurance policy for its fair market value. Life settlements frequently involve policies that are failing because they lack sufficient cash value to pay the annual insurance costs and/or the policy owner can no longer afford the premium payments. Professionals should be aware that institutionally-funded providers offer purchase programs that address common life insurance management problems.},

@article{Atmeh2011,
abstract = {American law requires an insurable interest—a pecuniary or affective stake in the subject of an insurance policy—as a predicate to properly obtaining insurance. In theory, the rule prevents both wagering on individual lives and moral hazard. In practice, the doctrine is avoided by complex insurance transaction structuring to effectuate both origination and transfers of insurance by individuals without an insurable interest. This paper argues that it is time to abandon the insurable interest doctrine. As both the English and Australian experiences indicate, elimination of the insurable interest doctrine will have little detrimental pecuniary effect on the insurance industry, while freeing consumers considerably. Indeed, New York comes to the brink of eliminating the doctrine in its recent decision in Kramer v. Phoenix Life Insurance Co. by sanctioning an immediate life insurance assignment procedure that in effect eliminates the need for an insurable interest in the assignee. However, Delaware, in PHL Variable Insurance Co. v. Price Dawe 2006 Insurance Trust and Lincoln National Life Insurance Co. v. Joseph Schlanger 2006 Insurance Trust, breathes new life into an old doctrine. Overall, though, adhering to an arcane doctrine that prevents the value of an insurance policy from being realized without extreme legal burden both hampers the market and harms consumers, as the benefits of such transactions are both lessened by transaction costs and accrue to only a select few individuals.},

abstract = {Life insurance planning isn't always about making sure someone has enough coverage. It's also about finding solutions for people who have too much. In some instances the best alternative is neither to hold the policy nor to surrender it. This article explains how CPAs can use a third option-a life settlement-to help eligible clients and employers dispose of unneeded life insurance policies now for more than the cash value rather than wait for the policy to pay off at the insured's death. A life settlement turns insurance assets into cash, giving the original policyholder an amount greater than the cash surrender value in exchange for ownership of the policy. This option creates immediate revenue for companies or individuals holding unprofitable or unneeded policies. When an individual or business engages in a life settlement transaction, the amount it recoups is based on the policy's face amount and cash surrender value as well as other factors, such as the insured's health, age and the current policy premium.},

Institutional investors and sophisticated individual investors are searching for investment returns that are not linked to bonds, equities, or commodities. In the late 1990s investment bankers and hedge fund investment managers turned to the secondary market for life insurance to create such an investment class-life settlement-backed securities. The demand for the new securities had been so great, prior to the financial crisis that began last fall, that syndicators and promoters required amounts of life insurance on older-age individuals that exceeded the supply available through normal functioning of the secondary market. The unprecedented demand for life policies on older-aged individuals produced life insurance applications and arrangements that tested the boundaries of state insurable interest laws. This article will explain the tension between life settlement-backed securities and state insurable interest laws. The article also will overview regulatory developments that should assuage this tension.},

Despite the growing frequency and popularity of STOLI transactions, there has been much discussion, but a lack of academic research, on the issues and challenges they have generated. The purpose of this research is to shed some light on this innovative insurance transaction by providing a clearer understanding of the controversy created by the STOLI phenomenon, and to argue that regulatory action aimed at restricting or prohibiting these transactions seems unnecessary. After examining the controversy generated by STOLI transactions from the perspective of consumers, insurance carriers, and state insurance regulators, we review the primary initiatives to regulate STOLI transactions, analyze the concerns that have been raised about these transactions, and conclude with proposals for market-based solutions and other reforms to address these concerns and other issues that have given rise to the STOLI controversy.},

abstract = {In this article we illustrate how the yield on an investment in a block of life settlement contracts changes across prices paid for the policies and how the yield for an offered price changes when the actual life of the insured extends beyond life expectancy. The reader will see that earning yields between 7% and 11%, figures that have in the last few years been touted in the life settlement industry, are associated with offers for policies that are relatively high discounts from face value, and that even a six-month extension in life beyond the life expectancy reduces the actual yield an investor will earn, below the 7% to 11% range. Once fees are deducted each period, which is the way the managers and owners of investment funds are compensated, the discount from face value consistent with each yield is reduced even further. Our objective has not been to find the appropriate discount rate for a pool of senior life settlements but more simply to illustrate how the required yield on an actual block of life settlement contracts dictates the price that investors can offer for policies. We also show that as required returns increase, the value that can be offered for life settlement contracts approaches the cash surrender value.},

abstract = {... So, the industry shifted to buying life insurance policies insuring the lives of people with other terminal illnesses; then, to buying policies of old people who were not terminally ill; then, to encouraging older people to buy insurance policies for the express purpose of selling them to investors; and finally, to bundling those policies together, securitizing them, and selling pieces of the bundles to investors. ... On his application, Rucker said the policy was not going to be transferred to investors, and investors were not going to pay the policy premiums. ... The court noted that incontestability clauses operate as statutes of limitations that keep insurance companies from continuing to collect premiums and reap profits until they have to pay out on policies, which they will refuse to do by claiming fraud or lack of insurable interest. ... As in most of them, the new Arizona statute provides that insureds may not enter into life settlement contracts within two years of the issuance of policies, with exceptions similar to those in the New York statute. ... Arizona's statute suggests legislators there, like legislators in almost all other states with similar statutes, had a great deal of concern about promoters of life settlement agreements engaging in fraud and encouraging insureds and investors to enter into transactions that were not appropriate for them. ... States became more amenable to various gambling enterprises because they were a source of revenue for the government. ... Although life insurance companies oppose life settlements, they also provide the policies for those arrangements by encouraging consumers to purchase whole life policies (and their variants) instead of term insurance. ... Other risks for investors in life settlement funds include: liquidity risk because cash outflows to pay premiums and fund redemptions occur regularly, whereas cash inflows from death benefits and new investments are unpredictable; policy availability risk; operational risks including litigation that can cost more than the death benefits; credit risk caused by the possible failure of the insurance carriers that underwrite the policies; and regulation risk because of changes in state and federal laws.},

Ironically, the amended Model Act most likely will result in a much greater diversification of life settlement statutes among states that regulate life settlements, rather than the national uniform standard that the NAIC had perhaps hoped would result from its efforts.

Although as a general rule the purchaser of an insurance policy must possess an insurable interest in the insured's life, controversy exists as to whether a person without an insurable interest, such as a viatical settlement company, may obtain an insurance policy by assignment. This goal is accomplished by requiring viatical settlement companies to procure a witnessed, signed statement from the terminally ill individual attesting that the viator freely consents to the contract, acknowledges the illness, understands the risks and benefits of the settlement, and releases all medical records to the viatical company. Opponents contend that licensing requirements stifle a terminally ill individual's opportunity to take full advantage of the viatical settlement industry by excluding willing purchasers from the market. The ruling addressed a taxpayer's irrevocable assignment of a life insurance policy to a viatical settlement company for approximately sixty-three percent of the policy's face value. The Service ruled that amounts received from the assignment of the life insurance policy to the viatical settlement company were "not amounts received under a life insurance contract by reason of the death of the insured.},

abstract = {Secondary life insurance markets are growing rapidly. From nearly no transactions in 1980, a wide variety of similar products in this market has developed, including viatical settlements, accelerated death benefits, and life settlements and as the population ages, these markets will become increasingly popular. Eight state governments, in a bid to guarantee sellers a "fair" price, have passed regulations setting a price floor on secondary life insurance market transactions, and more are considering doing the same. Using data from a unique random sample of HIV+ patients, we estimate welfare losses from transactions prevented by binding price floors in the viatical settlements market (an important segment of the secondary life insurance market). We find that price floors bind on HIV patients with greater than 4 years of life expectancy. Furthermore, HIV patients from states with price floors are significantly less likely to viaticate than similarly healthy HIV patients from other states. If price floors were adopted nationwide, they would rule out transactions worth $119 million per year. We find that the magnitude of welfare loss from these blocked transactions would be highest for consumers who are relatively poor, have weak bequest motives, and have a high rate of time preference.},

In a nutshell, a life insurance policyholder sells the benefits of the policy to an investor.

abstract = {Securitization has been an extremely important technique for managing exposure to a variety of financial risks. It allows the undesired risk to be concentrated in a small proportion of the newly created securities while largely eliminating its impact for most investors. Securitization had its very successful debut with mortgages, as a way to tap into funding from the bond market with mortgage-backed securities that were largely insulated from the inherent exposure of the underlying mortgages to prepayment risk. Since then, it has been extended to a wide range of securities and categories of risk. In this issue's Innovations section, Stone and Zissu describe a new kind of securitization, in which the risk to be managed is the risk of death. Or the opposite, actually: It is "longevity risk," the risk that an insured person will live too long, i.e., longer than their actuarial expected life span. A senior life settlement contract provides a way for a terminally ill, or very old, holder of a life insurance policy to liquidate it and obtain cash prior to death. The article describes how a portfolio of life settlement contracts may be securitized and tranched, and discusses pricing and risk management for the new securities.},

With very little federal oversight, the market flourished during the late '90s during the viatical settlement era and well into the 2000s in the form of the life settlement market. The financial meltdown that gripped the United States in late 2007 and continues today has garnered a call to action for the federal government to enact legislation to protect investors from abuses apparent in the investment community. It appears now that the legislative call to action may formally make its way into the LSIM. The Life Settlements Task Force ("LSTF"), created by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") in August 2009, was established to investigate and examine issues in the LSIM and to advise the SEC whether market practices in and regulatory oversight of the LSIM could be improved.

@article{Doherty2003,
abstract = {This Article analyzes the benefits that accrue to policyholders and incumbent insurers from an active secondary market for life insurance policies. It begins by examining the benefits of secondary markets in the home mortgage and catastrophic risk insurance industries as points of comparison for the benefits of the secondary market for life insurance policies. Next, it outlines the economic theory of a life insurance market both before and after the introduction of a secondary market. Without an active secondary market, the equilibrium quantity of "impaired'' policies surrendered is inefficiently low. Although competition among insurance companies in the primary market leads to reasonably competitive surrender values given normal health, surrender values based on normal health do not appropriately compensate individuals with impaired life expectancies for the resulting appreciation of their policies. If no external market for reselling policies exists, insurers have no incentive to adjust their surrender values for impaired policies to competitive levels because they wield monopsony power over the repurchase of impaired policies. Entry by firms in the secondary market erodes monopsony power. Finally, the Article examines the benefits of an active secondary market for life insurance policies to policyholders and incumbent insurers in the primary market and discusses the future of life settlements. The magnitude of the benefits is correlated positively to the quantity of coverage sold to life settlement firms and to the improvement in the terms of accelerated death benefits offered by incumbent carriers. The emergence of the secondary market for life insurance policies has been pro-competitive and pro-consumer. Lawmakers should therefore design regulations that encourage, rather than dissuade, participation and investment in this secondary market.},

@article{Richmond2012,
abstract = {Stranger-owned life insurance, commonly known by the acronym STOLI, has for several years been a key practice of the so-called life settlements industry. STOLI generally describes the purchase of life insurance by an insured with the intent of assigning ownership of the policy along with its death benefits to investors who do not have an insurable interest in the insured's life. State statutes regulating STOLI arrangements often define STOLI in this way. This is not a perfect description or definition of STOLI, however, because life settlement companies may purchase life insurance policies from individuals over the age of 65 who have remaining life expectancies of six to twelve years (although in some instances people with longer life expectancies may be considered), but who did not originally purchase their policies with the intent to transfer ownership of them to strangers. Insureds in this second category may seek to sell their policies because of shifts in personal financial preferences or due to changes in their circumstances, such as disability, divorce, retirement, or various forms of financial distress. This is still strangerowned life insurance, even if the original intent to transfer policy ownership is missing. [...]of these differences, and while the mechanics of STOLI transactions may vary-they commonly involve major cash payments to insureds by intermediaries or investors, the formation of irrevocable life insurance trusts, and premium financing, among other techniques9- STOLI is unquestionably more an investment vehicle than an insurance transaction. The basic concept is that the life settlement company that purchases the policy will pay the insured an amount greater than the cash surrender value of the policy but much less than the death benefit, will thereafter keep the policy in force until the insured dies, and will then profit by collecting the difference between the death benefit and the combination of the sum paid to the insured and the premiums paid to keep the policy in force.11 Life settlements may be securitized, such that investors who purchase the resulting bonds profit in essentially the same fashion.},

Institutional investors have come to realize that big blocks of properly underwritten policies acquired through life settlements can form a very predictable, very conservative, and very profitable source of income. Life insurance planners must not avoid involvement in or proper encouragement of life settlement options in the financial plans of their clientele.},

@article{Perez2002,
abstract = {As seniors struggle to keep pace with medical care costs and other expenses, many must look to alternative sources of financial freedom. Senior settlement agreements, through which a senior may sell her life insurance policy to a third party for a percentage of its future value, may provide one such alternative. In this Note, Jessica Maria Perez explores the history of senior settlement agreements from their birth as sisters to similar agreements made by the chronically ill, to the present in which they are increasingly entered into by healthy seniors. Perez analyzes the positive and negative aspects of these agreements from basic economic risk to ethical issues to tax implications. She analyzes recent regulatory developments in this area, including the Viatical Settlements Model Act and various state statutes. Perez recommends increased regulation at the state level, encouraging states to adopt the Model Act. She also recommends that these transactions be made tax-exempt and that attorneys play a greater role in the making of senior settlements. With these reforms, Perez suggests that the senior settlement agreement can be a safe and effective method by which seniors can realize financial freedom.},

@article{Ziser2005a,
abstract = {Over the past two years, the secondary market for life insurance policies, known as life settlements, has grown in the United States to a multi-billion dollar a year industry. Life settlement transactions have increased in volume and are likely to remain attractive due to the yields, the uncorrelated nature of the asset, and the flexibility available in structuring transactions that can accommodate investor preferences. Life settlements often can provide an alternative to seniors of which they were not previously aware. As the universe of parties that can facilitate life settlement transactions expands, more seniors will be presented with the possibility of doing a life settlement and the volume of transactions will increase. As the life settlement market continues to grow, the number of third-party service providers, such as verification agents and medical underwriters, is also likely to increase. The result will be a more robust and efficient market that will enable the participants to continue to benefit from this unique asset.},

We investigate the optimal weighting of these assets and their contribution to performance and portfolio risk. We find a significant negative correlation between the selected life settlement funds and certain U.S. and European fixed-income and equity funds. Furthermore, these correlations are lower than the correlations between the index funds that replicate each other. These results suggest that life settlement funds are an appropriate financial instrument to achieve greater diversification for a portfolio made up of a fund of funds and to improve fund performance as they provide a fixed return with a lower level of risk.},

Secondary markets for life insurance arose in the 1980s to address the needs of terminally ill policyholders with AIDS. By 2007 settlements stemming from secondary insurance had grown to as much as $6.1 billion. The authors examine the consequences for policy and welfare of these settlements.

This article will look at the legal and ethical issues surrounding one of the issues profiled on American Greed, namely stranger-owned life insurance. A critic of some in the industry is Open Life Settlements. They explain that a person who cannot afford to keep up the payments on a whole life policy can benefit by selling it rather than just turning it in for the cash settlement value. Open Life Settlements helps people who have bought insurance for legitimate reasons sell policies that are now unwanted or unneeded due to changed circumstances.},
